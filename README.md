Our project address the difficulty orphanages face to have all their needs met. We do this by:
1. Providing an independent platform for Orphanages to publicize their needs as well as a way for donors to donate towards the needs
2. Providing a platform for users to be an 'E-Parent' upon application and approval, thus being notified of their E-Child's needs and providing them a platform to fulfill the needs
3. Providing a space for orphanages to share resources and information via orphanageÂ partnering
