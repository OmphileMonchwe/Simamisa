Our project address the difficulty orphanages face to have all their needs met. We do this by, 1. Providing an independent platform for Orphanages to publicize their needs as well as a way for donors to donate towards the needs, 2. Providing a platform for users to be an 'E-Parent' upon application and approval, thus being notified of their E-Child's needs and providing them a platform to fulfill the needs, 3. Providing a space for orphanages to share resources and information via orphanageÂ partnering
